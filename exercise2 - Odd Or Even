# exercise
  Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?
  Extras:
  If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
  Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message

# Solution:
num = int(input('please kindly enter one integer:'))
check =int(input('please kindly enter another integer:'))
if num %2==0:
    print (str(num)+' is an Even.')
    if num % 4==0:
        print ('and it is a multiple of 4.')
else:
    print (str(num)+' is an Odd.')

if num%check==0:
    print (str(num) +' can be evenly divided by '+str(check))
else:
    print(str(num)+' is not a multiple of '+str(check))
